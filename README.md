# JUNKALLY

## Inspiration
Believe it or not, we drew our inspiration from waste! After having realised our huge role in plundering our environment we decided to not only try to give it up but also help others alleviate this by doing their role. We were inspired from this need to not let our consumerist natures completely destroy our beautiful environment.

## Overview
Our project, JunkAlly, acts as a bridge between small businesses/NGOs (who upcycle/recycle waste) and us consumers (notorious for generating the waste). It does so, by arranging for a pick up from the users for their waste and delivering them with our partners. The small businesses and NGOs get their material and the users, in turn for their initiative, get points in accordance with the weight of the waste that they've submitted which they can avail to get vouchers and discount coupons from our partners.
