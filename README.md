## Inspiration
Believe it or not, we drew our inspiration from waste! After having realised our huge role in plundering our environment we decided to not only try to give it up but also help others alleviate this by doing their role. We were inspired from this need to not let our consumerist natures completely destroy our beautiful environment.


## Overview
Our project, JunkAlly, acts as a bridge between small businesses/NGOs (who upcycle/recycle waste) and us consumers (notorious for generating the waste). It does so, by arranging for a pick up from the users for their waste and delivering them with our partners. The small businesses and NGOs get their material and the users, in turn for their initiative, get points in accordance with the weight of the waste that they've submitted which they can avail to get vouchers and discount coupons from our partners.

## JunkAlly
JunkAlly was born after having observed the pillaging that humans have inflicted on our environment, especially in the recent times. While one-time-use plastic notoriety is only increasing (and rightfully so), other crucial elements of our plunder remain out of the limelight.
JunkAlly acts as a bridge between the consumers (the generators of waste) and small businesses (which have the initiative and the resources to upcycle/recycle the said waste). It does so by connecting its users and the small businesses via an efficient point system whereby for every certain kilograms of waste that the user gives to the businesses, they acquire a set value of points which they can later redeem to avail discounts at the outlets of such small businesses. This way the businesses acquire material to create sustainable products and also get to reach a larger customer base while the customer is able to do their bit in contributing towards improving the environment while also receiving exciting discounts.
Through JunkAlly, we aim to efficiently employ the 3 important R’s (and more) and we believe that it has the potential to become a one-stop platform to alleviate excess and promote sustainability.
